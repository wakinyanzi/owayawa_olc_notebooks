# owayawa_olc_notebooks

## I created these notebooks for the Oglala Lakota College IT 203 - Programming class. I wanted to put them here so that others can use them to learn how Python. I integrated a lot of Oglala Lakota culture and Lakota Language.

## I hope you all grow to love both the Lakota and Python languages. They compliment each other very well.

# Have Fun Coding :)
